Assembly table 
====== 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
After finding the bottleneck of the production line, we determined the model change was slowing the line and also the cause for down time. By designing an attachment to the current table and implementing it, we reduced the model change operation time by 70%.   
</p>

Transportation 
====== 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
We found an opportunity area in the transport of the biggest coils through the assembly line. In the operation they'd need at least three workers to move the coil, but with our proposal with cranes, the operation would require only one worker.
