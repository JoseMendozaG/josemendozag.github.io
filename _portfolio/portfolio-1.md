Aplication
=====
Device focused in giving affordable, efective and customizalbe rehabilitation treatments for ankle injurys. 

Parallel Robot
=====
Six-degrees-of-freedom mechanism with two bodys (base and plate) conected with six linear actuators. I designed the universal joints on top and bottom of the device which made it cappable of holding up to 200 kg.

Control
=====
Design of the rutines based on inverse kinematics using a robust controller for each motor with a micro-controller card. An important part of the project was the precise caracterization of the linear actuators. 

Rutines
=====
By the end of my participation on the project, the device had four pre-programed rutines:

1. Dorsiflexion and Plantar flexion
2. Eversion and Inversion
3. Lateral rotation and Medial rotation
4. A combination of the above. 

All four rutines are customizable, varying the speed of the movement and the angle that each movement does.
