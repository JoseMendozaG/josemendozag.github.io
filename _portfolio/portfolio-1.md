## Aplication
=====
Device focused in giving affordable, efective and customizalbe rehabilitation treatments for ankle injurys. 

## Parallel Robot
=====
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Six-degrees-of-freedom mechanism with two bodys (base and plate) conected with six linear actuators. I designed the universal joints on top and bottom of the device which made it cappable of holding up to 200 kg.

## Control
=====
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Design of a robust controller based on a Super-twisting PD controller for each individual motor programed into a micro-controller. An important part of the project was the precise caracterization of the linear actuators.

The rutines were programed in simulink (for a visual representation of the process) using inverse kinematics. The position for each motor was sent to the micro-controller by a serial communication protocol that we designed. 
</p> 

## Rutines
=====
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
By the end of my participation on the project, the device had four pre-programed rutines:

1. Dorsiflexion and Plantar flexion
2. Eversion and Inversion
3. Lateral rotation and Medial rotation
4. A combination of the above. 

All four rutines are customizable, varying the speed of the movement and the angle that each movement does.
