I worked along side a robotics' doctor on the design of a kid-size-humanoid (120 cm) focucused on the ankles' movement. We stared with the kinematics model and designed the structure based on given motors, using two motors for the pitch' joints. For the materials we selected aluminum and carbon fiber due to it's lightweight and strength.
