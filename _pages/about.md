I am an enthusiastic mechatronics engineeer with experience in mechanical design. My goal is to aplly my wide knowledge in CAD design into the machines that will change the world for a better future. 

About Myself
======
I graduated from the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) as a mechatronics engineer. Through my studies I had the opportunity to work several times with multi-disciplinary teams achieving awesome projects like an Ankle Rehabilitation Platform, a beach cleaner robot, among others. My main strength is the mechanical design, starting projects from scratch, modeling in CAD software, manufacturing pieces and assembling everything together to work the correct way. Also, I value my capability to keep improving designs as I detect issues or opportunity areas in them.  

On the other hand, my eager to always learn something new has led me to be part of different product lines at John Deere. As a Product Designer I’ve worked with Combine Harvesters, Planters and Self-Propelled Sprayers doing hydraulics and solution routings. I am still learning and doing my best to put that knowledge into practice.
